The heritage building located in the heart of the city’s Civic District contains a 614-seat Theatre and a 673-seat Concert Hall.In 2010, the national monument underwent a four-year refurbishment to restore its neo-classical façade while getting new state-of-the-art facilities and amenities. The redevelopment also saw the addition of two smaller rooms for music, dance and theatre rehearsals.Having played a role in the country’s history for over 150 years, the Victoria Theatre & Victoria Concert Hall continues to be an exciting mid-sized platform, supporting the growth of Singapore’s arts industry.Victoria Theatre & Victoria Concert Hall is managed by Arts House Ltd. Constructed between 1855 and 1862 and originally built as a Town Hall, Victoria Theatre is the older of the two buildings that make up this performing arts venue. The Town Hall was converted into a theatre in 1908 and was renamed Victoria Theatre.\r\n\r\nVictoria Theatre is set in a black box, offering a seating capacity of 614 and the flexibility for the formation of an extended forestage or an orchestra pit when required. When the orchestra pit is in use, the seating capacity is 536. The Theatre is wheelchair accessible in the Stalls area.\r\n\r\nThe intimate space features a curved seating plan that “hugs” the stage, bringing the audience closer to performers. Cast-iron components were taken from the old Theatre’s chairs and re-purposed into horizontal bands set across the timber walls to improve the acoustics of the space.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the Theatre is a suite, which can be used as a private hospitality suite or as an extension of the Theatre Main Foyer, suitable for a maximum of 10 – 15 people.",

The heritage building located in the heart of the city’s Civic District contains a 614-seat Theatre and a 673-seat Concert Hall.In 2010, the national monument underwent a four-year refurbishment to restore its neo-classical façade while getting new state-of-the-art facilities and amenities. The redevelopment also saw the addition of two smaller rooms for music, dance and theatre rehearsals.Having played a role in the country’s history for over 150 years, the Victoria Theatre & Victoria Concert Hall continues to be an exciting mid-sized platform, supporting the growth of Singapore’s arts industry.Victoria Theatre & Victoria Concert Hall is managed by Arts House Ltd. Formerly called Victoria Memorial Hall, the Concert Hall was built between 1902 and 1905 in honor of Queen Victoria. The Memorial Hall played a significant role in Singapore’s history, serving as a makeshift hospital during World War II and as a venue for the inaugural meeting of the People’s Action Party in 1954. The Victoria Memorial Hall was renovated in the 1970s to serve as a concert hall. Today, the Victoria Concert Hall is the home of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra.\r\n\r\nWith 673 seats, the Concert Hall has retained much of its old-world charm of classical proportions and ornamentation. In the latest refurbishment, the balcony overhang on the second floor was reduced and raised to free up the volume and to enhance acoustics, simultaneously resulting in better views from all seats. A coffered ceiling has been installed to suit acoustic requirements and to harmonise with the proportions of the hall. A grand Klais pipe organ consisting of 2,012 pipes takes center stage. The Concert Hall is wheelchair accessible in the Stalls area.",

        "description": "FYR Cycene Ond Drinc (pronounced as FIRE Kitchen and Drink) is a casual dining restaurant and bar located at 19, Boon Tat Street. Against the backdrop of Chinatown’s historic allure, FYR promises an intriguing experience that harks back to a simpler time. It’s interior is a decidedly rugged vibe, flavoured by an overhanging vintage chandelier, sepia-hued wall mural and hardwood benches. \r\n\r\nEven its moniker is as old as time – it is the etymology of fire, the chiefest of elements in cooking. Juxtaposing this intricate tapestry of olden-day charm is FYR’s modern European-style cuisines. Exotic herbs and spices of Southeast Asia go into every dish, intensifying the taste. All of FYR’s cuisine and dishes are whipped up using the Josper Charcoal Oven. The chefs of FYR use lychee wood, which gives the dishes a wonderful smoky note that is tinged with sweetness. FYR is helmed by a management team and key service staff who collectively have more than 15 years of experience. With good food and the lively atmosphere, this area is perfect hosting all kinds of activities such as birthday parties, bachelor parties, hen parties and so forth. ",

The Projector resides in an often overlooked piece of local architecture - Golden Mile Tower, a modernist architectural icon of early Singapore. The space calls subtle attention to the past glory of a beloved old cinema. Special elements of the space harken back to its  vintage signage, original flip-up theatre seats with wooden armrests, fabric walls, and floor lettering denoting the rows of seats have all been retained. \r\n\r\nWith a classic cinema hall, an experimental cinema and entertainment space with extended stage, and a sunlit cafe foyer with panoramic city views, The Projector is an ideal setting for a range of traditional or one-of-a-kind events, from a simple event such as a corporate seminar to a huge and lavish event like a product launch or product exhibition, The Projector got you covered!\r\n\r\nEither or both of our halls (left, right) are available for hire, each includes use of the Cafe reception/lobby area (below right) for additional space and programming needs. Each hall has been updated and redesigned to facilitate a range of events types. The space is easily accessible via direct elevator from the ground floor.
