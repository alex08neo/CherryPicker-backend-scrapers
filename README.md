## How to start development:

### (1) Install Pip

### (2) Install PipEnv as package manager
* Recommended to use PipEnv to manage python packages. PipEnv is just like NPM. It helps you to download the dependencies required for the python project. See more in this [link:](https://medium.com/@krishnaregmi/pipenv-vs-virtualenv-vs-conda-environment-3dde3f6869ed)
* To use pipenv, you need to install pip.`pip install pipenv`
* Next, you create a new environment by using the command `pipenv install` This will look for a pipenv file, if it doesnâ€™t exist, it will create a new environment and activate it.
* To activate it `pipenv shell`
* To install a new package do `pipenv install <packageName>` so that pipenv will add the package to the pipenv file called Pipfile

### (2.1) Subsequent runs after the above configuration
* Activate pipenv by using the command  `pipenv shell`

### (3) Use the Requirements.txt
* To download all the required dependencies, simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Whenever you download a new library, add it to requirements.txt by doing `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
